# gzsize

`gzsize` is a lightweight tool to measure the decompressed size of a GZip’d
file.

It works by decompressing it on the fly but doesn’t write the data which means
you can test any file size without worrying for your disk usage.

## Install

    git clone https://github.com/bfontaine/gzsize.git
